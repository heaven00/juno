Juno
====

Part of the project we did for sequoia hack 2016. Juno is a python api based application over an amazing paper and implementation using Deep-CNN to convert 2D images to 3D objects.

Other then the small image pre-processing to handle various images rest of the code is picked up from https://github.com/chrischoy/3D-R2N2

The project is able to convert images from ebay, amazon to 3D objects but images taken from webcam or phone camera comes out super funny or weird.

TODO:

  - Add Documentation

**NOTE: Needs the weights to run.**
